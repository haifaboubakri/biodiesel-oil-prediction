# Biodiesel Prediction Using Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs biodiesel prediction based on input parameters. The project utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the yield and quality of biodiesel from various feedstocks.

## Contents

- `diesoil.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation for biodiesel prediction.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
